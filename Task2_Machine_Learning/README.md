Task-2: Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning
Internship Project – CODTECH
Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict customer payment value using historical e-commerce transaction data.

Dataset

Processed e-commerce transaction dataset derived from Task-1, containing relevant numerical and categorical features for predictive modeling.

Analysis Performed

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Encoding of categorical variables

Feature selection and train-test split

Model training using Random Forest Regressor

Model evaluation using MAE and R² score

Key Insights

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ≈ 0.54 indicating low prediction error.

R² Score ≈ 0.40, showing moderate explanatory power of the model.

Price and shipping charges are the strongest predictors of payment value.

Tree-based models capture non-linear relationships better than linear models.

Results can support sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and revenue planning.

Tools Used
