# **TASK-2: PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING**
**Internship Project – CODTECH**

## **OBJECTIVE**
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer payment values using historical e-commerce transaction data, enabling accurate sales forecasting, revenue planning, and customer insights.

## **DATASET**
Processed e-commerce transaction dataset derived from Task-1, including relevant numerical and categorical features for predictive modeling.

## **ANALYSIS PERFORMED**
- **Data preprocessing & cleaning:** handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies  
- **Encoding of categorical variables:** transformed categorical features into numerical format  
- **Feature selection & train-test split:** identified key predictors and split data for training and evaluation  
- **Model training:** implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** to capture non-linear patterns  
- **Model evaluation:** assessed performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R² score**

## **KEY INSIGHTS**
- **MAE ≈ 0.54**, indicating low prediction error  
- **R² Score ≈ 0.40**, showing moderate explanatory power  
- **Top Predictors:** Price and shipping charges  
- Tree-based models capture non-linear relationships better than linear models  
- Results can support sales forecasting, customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and revenue planning

## **TOOLS USED**
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
